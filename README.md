## JPA Legacy Database Mapping

This project demonstrates JPA legacy database mapping using the WordPress database schema. We're using Spring Data JPA to map and interact with an existing WordPress database structure, showcasing how to work with legacy databases in modern Java applications.

Key features of this demonstration include:

1. Mapping WordPress tables to JPA entities
2. Handling WordPress-specific data types and relationships
3. Implementing custom queries for WordPress data structures
4. Demonstrating how to work with legacy database schemas without modifying the original structure

## Additional Resources

For more information about transactions in database systems and Spring Data JPA, please refer to the following documents in the `doc` folder:

- [Overview of DB Transactions](doc/OverviewOfDBTransactions.pdf): This document provides a comprehensive overview of database transactions.
- [Spring Data JPA Transactions](doc/SpringDataJPATransactions.pdf): This guide offers insights into how transactions work specifically with Spring Data JPA.


## Flyway

To enable Flyway in the MySQL profile, override the following properties when starting the application:
- `spring.flyway.enabled = true`
- `spring.docker.compose.file = compose-mysql.yaml`

This profile starts MySQL on port 3306 using the Docker Compose file `compose-mysql-.yaml`.

## Docker

Docker Compose file initially use the startup script located in `src/scripts`. These scripts create the database and users.

## Kubernetes

### Generate Config Map for mysql init script

When updating 'src/scripts/init-mysql-mysql.sql', apply the changes to the Kubernetes ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl create configmap mysql-init-script --from-file=init.sql=src/scripts/init-mysql.sql --dry-run=client -o yaml | Out-File -Encoding utf8 k8s/mysql-init-script-configmap.yaml
```

### Deployment

To deploy all resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

To remove all resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```

Check
```bash
kubectl get deployments -o wide
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Running the Application
1. Choose between h2 or mysql for database schema management. (you can use one of the preconfigured intellij runners)
2. Start the application with the appropriate profile and properties.
3. The application will use Docker Compose to start MySQL and apply the database schema changes.
